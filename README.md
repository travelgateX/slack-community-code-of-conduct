Scope
-----

We expect all members of the TravelgateX community, including paid and unpaid agents, administrators, users, facilitators, and vendors to abide by this Code of Conduct at all times in all TravelgateX community venues, online and in person, and in one-on-one communications pertaining to TravelgateX affairs.

This policy covers the usage of the TravelgateX forums, as well as the TravelgateX website, TravelgateX related events, and any other services offered under the name of TravelgateX (collectively, the "Service"). It also applies to behavior in the context of the TravelgateX Open Source project communities, including but not limited to public GitHub repositories, IRC channels, social media, mailing lists, and public events.

This Code of Conduct is in addition to, and does not in any way nullify or invalidate, any other terms or conditions related to use of the Service.

The definitions of various subjective terms such as "discriminatory", "hateful", or "confusing" will be decided at the sole discretion of the TravelgateX abuse team.

Friendly Harassment-Free Space
------------------------------

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics.

We ask that you please respect that people have differences of opinion regarding technical choices, and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a single right answer. A difference of technology preferences is not a license to be rude.

Disputes over package rights must be handled respectfully, according to the terms described in the TravelgateX Dispute Resolution document. There is never a good reason to be rude over package name disputes.

Any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome, and will not be tolerated.

Harassing other users of the Service is never tolerated, whether via public or private media.

Avoid using offensive or harassing package names, nicknames, or other identifiers that might detract from a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics; inappropriate use of nudity, sexual images, and/or sexually explicit language in public spaces; threats of physical or non-physical harm; deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.

Acceptable Content
------------------

The Service administrators reserve the right to make judgement calls about what is and isn't appropriate in published content. These are guidelines to help you be successful in our community.

Content must contain something applicable to the previously stated goals of the TravelgateX community. "Spamming", that is, publishing any form of content that is not applicable, is not allowed.

Content must not contain illegal or infringing content. You should only publish content to the Service if you have the right to do so. This includes complying with all software license agreements or other intellectual property restrictions. For example, redistributing an MIT-licensed module with the copyright notice removed, would not be allowed. You will be responsible for any violation of laws or othersâ€™ intellectual property rights.

Content must not be malware. For example, content (code, video, pictures, words, etc.) which is designed to maliciously exploit or damage computer systems, is not allowed.

Content name, description, and other visible metadata must not include abusive, inappropriate, or harassing content.

Reporting Violations of this Code of Conduct
--------------------------------------------

If you believe someone is harassing you or has otherwise violated this Code of Conduct, please contact us at [abuse@travelgatex.com](mailto:abuse@travelgatex.com) to send us an abuse report. If this is the initial report of a problem, please include as much detail as possible. It is easiest for us to address issues when we have more context.

Copyright Violations
--------------------

We respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you do too. If you believe any package or other materials available through the Service violates a copyright held by you and you would like to submit a notice pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or other similar international law, you can submit a notice to our agent for service of notice at:

[abuse@travelgatex.com](mailto:abuse@travelgatex.com)

Please make sure your notice meets the Digital Millennium Copyright Act requirements.

Consequences
------------

All content published to the Service, including user account credentials, is hosted at the sole discretion of the TravelgateX administrators.

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors, employees, customers, or others with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the TravelgateX administrators may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event or service).

Addressing Grievances
---------------------

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the TravelgateX team. We will do our best to ensure that your grievance is handled appropriately.

In general, we will choose the course of action that we judge as being most in the interest of fostering a safe and friendly community.

Contact Info
------------

Please contact [abuse@travelgatex.com](mailto:abuse@travelgatex.com) if you need to report a problem or address a grievance related to an abuse report.

You are also encouraged to contact us if you are curious about something that might be "on the line" between appropriate and inappropriate content. We are happy to provide guidance to help you be a successful part of our community.
